# Market Basket Analysis for Retailers

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to identify associations between products using market basket analysis techniques, helping retailers optimize inventory and cross-selling strategies.

## Dataset:
This project uses the [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains transactional data from a UK-based online retailer and includes information such as product descriptions, quantities, and prices.

## Short Description:
The project analyzes transaction data to uncover patterns in customer purchases and recommends product pairings or promotions. By applying association rule mining (using algorithms like Apriori and FP-Growth), we aim to identify frequently purchased product combinations and visualize these relationships using network diagrams.

## Guidelines:
1. **Perform Association Rule Mining**: Use techniques such as Apriori or FP-Growth to identify frequent itemsets.
2. **Visualize Relationships**: Create network diagrams to represent the relationships between products based on association rules.
3. **Recommendation Engine**: Implement a recommendation engine that suggests products based on customer purchase history.
4. **Consider Seasonality and Trends**: Analyze sales data to understand trends and seasonal fluctuations in purchasing behavior.

## Code Structure:
### 1. **Installing Required Libraries**:
The project relies on the following libraries:
- `mlxtend` for association rule mining
- `networkx` for creating network diagrams
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` for visualization

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
!pip install mlxtend
```

## Usage:
### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-basket-analysis.git
```

## Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the analysis:
```bash
python market_basket_analysis_for_retailers.ipynb
