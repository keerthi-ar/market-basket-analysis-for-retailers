# Market Basket Analysis for Retailers

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to identify associations between products using market basket analysis techniques, helping retailers optimize inventory and cross-selling strategies.

## Dataset:
This project uses the [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains transactional data from a UK-based online retailer and includes information such as product descriptions, quantities, and prices.

## Project Overview:
In this project, we analyze transactional data to uncover patterns in customer purchases. Using association rule mining techniques such as Apriori and FP-Growth, we aim to identify frequently purchased product combinations. These insights can be used to recommend product pairings or promotions. Additionally, we visualize product relationships using network diagrams.

### Steps Taken:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
    - Explored and cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and removing irrelevant data.
    -  Converted categorical variables (e.g., product categories) into numerical representations suitable for association rule mining.
2. Association Rule Mining:
    - Applied Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms to identify frequent itemsets and association rules.
    - Generated association rules with high confidence and lift to find product combinations frequently bought together.
3. Visualization:
    - Created network diagrams to visually represent the relationships between products based on the association rules.
    - Analyzed how products are connected and identified key product pairs.
4. Recommendation Engine:
    - Built a recommendation engine that suggests products based on customer purchase history and association rules.
5. Seasonality and Trends:
    - Analyzed the sales data to identify trends and seasonal fluctuations in customer purchasing behavior.
